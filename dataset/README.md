## Problematic 
Predictive model applied to a metallic soil remediation framework and using inductive detection systems

## Issue of the study

The challenge of this study is to propose an analysis optimization of the composition of a soil of its metal objects to derive from an estimate of a pollution rate allowing to prioritize the places to be decontaminated.
  
Indeed, the presence of metallic pollutants, in particular heavy metals in the soil poses significant toxicity problems, knowing that these pollutants can migrate (under the effect of water flow, handling of the earth, plantations, environmental acidification, etc.).
  
This optimization involves acquiring signals from the metal detection tool (Inductive Detection System), and studying its data.
The study may focus on several influencing parameters, whether about the object, or even soil parameters.


## Production of the study

- Implementation of one or more means of identifications and predictions of metallic objects thanks to software generated signals.
- Establishment of pollution estimates of several terrains (generation of dataset simulating signals) according to the identifications of metals, and classifying it to prioritize depollution.
